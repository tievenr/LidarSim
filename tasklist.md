We need to refactor both files to create a robust and efficient visualization system. Here is a plan to fix the issues we identified, starting with the `CircularPointBuffer` and then moving on to `LidarSensor`.

### Phase 1: Refactoring `CircularPointBuffer.js`

The goal is to simplify the API, improve performance, and remove redundant state.

1.  **Remove Redundancy**: Get rid of the `add` method. The `addBatch` method is more efficient and is the only one used by the consumer.
2.  **Streamline State**: The `lastReadIndex` and `headIndex` are all we need for the core logic. We can get rid of `addedSinceLastRead`, `frameAdditionCount`, and other redundant state variables.
3.  **Improve `getPoints` Logic**:
    * Create a single, public method `getUpdateInfo()` that returns all the necessary information for a visualization update in one go.
    * This method will return an object containing the `lastReadIndex`, `headIndex`, and a `Float32Array` of all the new points to be visualized. This simplifies the consumer's logic.
    * This method will also be responsible for calling `markVisualizationRead()` internally, ensuring that the state is updated atomically.
4.  **Enhance Performance**: The `getUpdateInfo()` method will use a single `Float32Array` to build the new points, avoiding multiple `subarray` calls and copies. The visualization component will then take this array and handle the rest.

### Phase 2: Refactoring `LidarSensor.jsx`

The goal is to create a lean, single-pass update loop that correctly handles the data provided by the new `CircularPointBuffer`.

1.  **Simplify `useFrame`**: The `useFrame` hook will become much simpler. It will only do two things:
    * Call the `castRaysForFrame()` method to get new points.
    * Call a single update function that handles all visualization logic.
2.  **Create a `visualizePoints()` Function**: This new function will be responsible for all visualization updates.
    * It will get the `updateInfo` from the `CircularPointBuffer` in a single call.
    * It will use the `updateInfo` to correctly copy the new points into the `BufferGeometry`'s attributes.
    * It will use the `updateRange` to tell Three.js exactly what part of the geometry needs to be re-uploaded to the GPU. This will handle both linear updates and wraparound updates in a single block of code, eliminating the need for complex, uncoordinated `if` statements.
3.  **Remove Redundant State Checks**: The code will no longer need `pointBuffer.getOverwrittenPositions()`. The `updateInfo` from the refactored buffer will contain everything needed to handle overwrites. The new logic will simply replace the overwritten points with the new ones.
4.  **Improve Readability**: The refactored code will be easier to read and maintain, as the state management will be centralized in the `CircularPointBuffer` and the visualization logic will be a single, coherent function.
