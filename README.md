Autonomous Vehicle Simulation with Livotech MID 360 LiDAR**  

This project simulates a **360Â° LiDAR environment** for **Digital Twin** applications, focusing on autonomous vehicle testing. Built with **React, Three.js, and @react-three/fiber**, it uses a placeholder **Livotech MID 360 LiDAR** to scan and generate simulated point clouds of the environment.  

## **Features**  
- 3D environment with interactive objects (e.g., boxes, spheres) and a ground plane.  
- Livotech MID 360 LiDAR placeholder with rotating LiDAR scanning.  
- Interactive camera controls using `OrbitControls`.  
- Performance stats using `Stats`.  
- Simulated point cloud generation to mimic LiDAR data output.  

## **Setup**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tievenr/LidarSim.git
   cd LidarSim
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
