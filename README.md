Autonomous Vehicle Simulation with Livotech MID 360 LiDAR**  

This project simulates a **360Â° LiDAR environment** for my personal **Digital Twin** applications. Built with **React, Three.js, and @react-three/fiber**, it uses a placeholder **Livotech MID 360 LiDAR**(currently low fidelity) to scan and generate simulated point clouds of the environment.  

## **Setup**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tievenr/LidarSim.git
   cd LidarSim
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:  
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
