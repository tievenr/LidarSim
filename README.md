# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation with Livotech MID 360 LiDAR

This project simulates a **360Â° LiDAR environment** for digital twin and autonomous vehicle research. Built with **React**, **Three.js**, and **@react-three/fiber**, it provides a performant, extensible platform for generating and visualizing LiDAR point clouds in real time.

## Features

### LiDAR Simulation
- **Realistic Scan Pattern:** Simulates a rotating multi-channel LiDAR with configurable vertical and horizontal FOV, scan rate, and channel count.
- **Raycasting-Based Sensing:** Uses Three.js raycasting to simulate laser beams and compute hit points, distances, and intensities.
- **Circular Buffer System:** Efficiently manages large point clouds (50,000+ points) using a circular buffer to avoid memory bloat.
- **Frame-Based Capture:** Supports frame-by-frame point cloud capture for time-series analysis and dataset creation.

### Data Handling & Export
- **PCD Export:** Exports point cloud frames in the industry-standard PCD format, compatible with tools like CloudCompare and PCL.
- **ZIP Archive Export:** Bundles multiple frames and metadata into a single ZIP file for easy download.
- **Voxel Filtering:** Reduces redundant points using a voxel grid filter for efficient storage and visualization.

### Visualization & Controls
- **Real-Time Point Cloud Rendering:** Visualizes LiDAR returns as a dynamic point cloud using Three.js Points.
- **Interactive Scene Navigation:** Orbit, pan, and zoom controls for exploring the simulated environment.
- **Configurable Parameters:** UI controls for scan rate, points per frame, max range, and more.
- **Capture Controls:** Start/stop recording and export data directly from the UI.

## Data Flow Overview

1. **Scene Setup**
   - The environment is constructed using Three.js meshes (ground, road, static/dynamic objects).
   - BVH acceleration structures are computed for all static meshes to optimize raycasting.

2. **LiDAR Sensor Simulation**
   - The `LidarSensor` component manages the virtual LiDAR, updating scan angles and firing rays each frame.
   - For each scan, rays are cast from the sensor position in directions determined by the scan pattern and channel configuration.

3. **Raycasting & Point Generation**
   - Each ray uses Three.js's accelerated raycasting (with BVH) to find intersections with scene objects.
   - For each intersection, the hit point, intensity (based on material and angle), and timestamp are recorded.

4. **Point Buffering**
   - Points are stored in a high-performance circular buffer, supporting efficient incremental updates and visualization.
   - The buffer is updated every frame, and old points are overwritten as new data arrives.

5. **Visualization**
   - The point buffer is mapped to a Three.js `BufferGeometry` and rendered as a point cloud.
   - Only new or changed points are updated on the GPU each frame for maximum efficiency.

6. **Export & Filtering**
   - Captured frames can be exported as PCD files or zipped archives.
   - Optional voxel filtering reduces point cloud density for storage or downstream processing.

## Performance Optimizations

- **BVH Acceleration:** All static meshes use [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh) for fast raycasting, enabling real-time simulation even with complex geometry.
- **Circular Buffer:** Point cloud data is managed in a circular buffer to minimize memory allocations and garbage collection.
- **Incremental GPU Updates:** Only new or changed points are sent to the GPU each frame, reducing WebGL overhead.
- **Distance-Based Culling:** Meshes outside the LiDAR's effective range are excluded from raycasting to further improve performance.
- **Frame Throttling:** LiDAR updates are throttled to a target FPS to balance accuracy and browser responsiveness.
- **Voxel Filtering:** Optional downsampling of point clouds using a voxel grid to reduce redundancy.
